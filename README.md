# InterviewExamples

The purpose of this project is to compile solutions to a list of commonly asked interview questions for software engineer jobs. The main audience of this project is new ingeneers wanting to get their first industry job. Rather than focusing on tricks or highly advance algorthims, this project will focus in commonly known algorithms and data structures.


If you have a better solution to any of the questions please start a new function with the same name of the original solution but append "V2", "V3", etc.
